We add full support for accelerations. You can assign ax and ay for each points
from the input file.

We augmented two sample inputs to help evaluate our extra credit implementation.
sample4.txt extends sample1.txt, adding accelerations for all the points.
Similarly, sample5.txt is an augmented version of sample2.txt. To run with
acceleration support, please use -a option. i.e.
java Main sample4.txt -a
java Main sample5.txt -a
